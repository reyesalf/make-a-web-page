         <div class="concept-description">
        <p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When we write in HTML, the browsers interpret the type of each element using HTML <b>tags</b>.</p>
        <p>A <b>tag</b> is always contained within angled brackets. Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag. Some tags (called <em>"void"</em> tags do not require a closing tag.</p>
        <p>An <b>element</b> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</p>
        <p>An <b>attribute</b> is a property of an HTML element. Elements can be <em><b>inline</b></em> or <b><em>block</em></b>. The difference between these elements is that block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them.</p>

        <p>HTML controls the structure of a web page. The browser turns HTML tags into elements in a tree structure. It knows how to do it due to a standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML called Documents Object Model (DOM).</p>

        <p>CSS controls the style of HTML elements using <em>selectors</em> (tags) to indicate the browser to apply rules to every element indicated by the selector. Everything indicated between the curly braces of the selector is interpreted as a rule. This rules are defined as <em>declaration</em> and composed by a property and the value of that property.</p>
        <p>The style can be added to certain selectors using class selectors.</p>

        <div class="concept-description">
        <p>HTML elements are boxes and each box has 4 components: margin, border, padding and content.</p>
        <p>It can often be hard to get the size of a box just right because there are so many components. Therefore there are two techniques that can help with sizing issues:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.</li>
            <li>Set the <em>"box sizing"</em> attribute to <em>"border box"</em> for every element.</li>

        <div class="concept-description">
        <p>Look for natural boxes on the design and get the structure of the web page right boxifying it. Then look for repeated styles and semantic elements. Write some code, test and see how it looks against the design mockup and then make some refinements applying styles (from biggest to smallest) so that it looks closer to the design. Finally fix things and validate the code. Avoiding repetition provides consistency and it is important to prevent errors when the programmer decides to make changes. </p>
